let name = "Dee"
let greeting = "Hi, my name is"

// writing greeting = "Hi, my name is " with a space after the "is" will give the same result as putting an empty " " before the name string

let myGreeting = (greeting + " " + "name")

console.log(myGreeting)


let points = 4
let bonusPoints = "10"

let totalPoints = points + bonusPoints
// the answer is 410 because strings always wins over numbers. So it just joined both numbers together


console.log(4 + 5) //9
console.log("2" + "4") //24
console.log("5" + 1) //51
console.log(100 + "100") //100100
